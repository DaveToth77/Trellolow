## User Story

AS A user

- I WANT an easy to use project management tool that provides one place to keep information and track of progress on a project, information, or idea.
  - SO THAT I can eliminate wasted time, lost ideas and notes, and improve my productivity and time management.

## CRITERIA

- GIVEN THAT I want to be able to organize my notes and lists digitally, in a single location, with authentication:
  - WHEN I open the app I want to be given an option to be directed to a log-in and/or signup page.
    - THEN I can chose a button, or link, to go to a page(s) where I will find a form to complete based on my option. 
  - WHEN I complete the form, by entering my information, depending upon whether it is my first time, or I am already registered,
    - THEN I can make another selection, which will take me to the main dashboard that contains a place for my information.
  - WHEN I reach the dashboard,
    - THEN I can choose to create a new list and give it a new title, or view and interact with lists that I have previously created, if any.
  - WHEN I have lists, they will be displayed across the screen with options for action, 
    - THEN I may choose to add a card, edit or view and existing list.
  - WHEN I choose to edit, or create, a card,
    - THEN a display will pop up and allow me to create a new card, or edit the information of the existing card.
  - WHEN I have completed the information,
